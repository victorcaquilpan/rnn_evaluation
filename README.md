# RNN Evaluation

In this repository, we use different RNN approaches to evaluate and compare their performance in the context of **Stock Market Prediction**. For this task, we implement **RNN**, **LSTM** and **GRU** architectures to do one-day ahead prediction (many-to-one problem) using different window slices. 

Moreover, this repository is divided in two parts. First part evaluate different RNN models, including results from a common statistical approach called **IMA**Second part, it dives in the implementation of different techniques to tackle different vanishing and exploding gradient problems.
